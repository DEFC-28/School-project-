   To reduce the risks caused by the summer monsoon, early warning systems must be improved across the country. Accurate weather forecasts help people prepare in advance for floods, landslides, and droughts. Emergency services should be well-equipped and trained to respond quickly during disasters. In schools and communities, awareness campaigns can teach people how to stay safe during heavy rains or water shortages.
       <br>
       <br>
Urban areas need stronger infrastructure to manage the effects of flooding. Governments should upgrade drainage systems and build flood barriers in cities like Mumbai that experience frequent waterlogging. In rural areas, small dams and canals can help control water flow and prevent soil erosion. These solutions will also help store rainwater for future use, especially during times of drought.
       <br>
       <br>
Farmers should be supported with training on climate-smart farming methods. They can grow drought-resistant crops and use techniques like drip irrigation to save water. At the same time, rainwater harvesting should be promoted in both rural and urban areas. To protect public health, clean drinking water and better sanitation must be ensured during the rainy season. With good planning, India can benefit from the monsoon while reducing its harmful impacts
