      <p class="para" >
        The summer monsoons in India have both positive and negative impacts on the country. While they bring much-needed rainfall that supports farming, water supply, and electricity generation, they can also cause serious problems like flooding, destruction of property, and loss of life. This research assumes that the monsoon season has both beneficial and harmful effects on the people, the economy, and the environment in India.

      <h4>Problem Statement : </h4>
     <p class="para">
       The summer monsoon is one of the most important weather systems in India, and it affects almost every part of the country. It brings heavy rainfall that is essential for agriculture, drinking water, and hydroelectric power. However, the same rains can also cause dangerous floods, landslides, and even droughts when the rains are late or not enough. These challenges put millions of people at risk each year. This research project investigates the impact of the summer monsoons in India to understand how they help and harm the country, and to find ways to reduce the negative effects while keeping the positive benefits
