     <p class="para">
       After completing this research, I accept the hypothesis that the summer monsoons have both positive and negative impacts in India. The monsoon season is very important because it brings rain needed for farming, water supply, and electricity. However, it also causes problems like floods, droughts, and damage to homes and roads.

The evidence from textbooks, maps, and online sources clearly shows that the monsoon is a powerful force that helps and harms the country depending on its strength and timing each year.
