       The summer monsoons are a seasonal weather pattern that brings heavy rainfall to large parts of South Asia, especially India. This weather system is driven by the movement of moist air from the Indian Ocean toward the land, beginning around June and continuing until September. As the land heats up in summer, it draws in this moist air, which leads to intense and continuous rainstorms across much of the country.

The monsoon is extremely important for Indiaâ€™s agriculture, as it provides most of the water needed for growing crops like rice, wheat, and sugarcane. It also helps to fill rivers, lakes, and dams that supply water for households and hydroelectric power. However, when the rains are too strong or last too long, they can cause serious problems such as floods, landslides, and damage to roads, houses, and crops. When the monsoon is weak or delayed, it can lead to droughts and food shortages
