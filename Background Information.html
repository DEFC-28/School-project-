In terms of demographics and social aspects, India is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Many rural communities depend heavily on agriculture, which in turn relies on monsoon rainfall. The monsoons directly influence food production, water availability, health conditions, and the overall economic stability of millions of people. Therefore, the summer monsoons have both beneficial and disruptive impacts on India’s social and environmental systems.
